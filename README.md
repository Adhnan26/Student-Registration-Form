🧑‍💻 Student Registration Form :

📘 Project Overview :
This project is a Student Registration Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to register student details like Name, Age, Gender, Course, and Email, and displays them in a dynamic table. Each record can also be deleted individually with a simple confirmation prompt.

This project marks my starting journey in JavaScript, and it’s my first-ever JS-based project — developed as part of my learning phase under my mentors’ guidance at [Error Makes Clever].

🧩 Features :

✅ Interactive Student Registration Form :

~ Input fields for Name, Age, Gender, Course, and Email

~ Dropdown for course selection

~ Radio buttons for gender

✅ Dynamic Table Update :

~ When a student registers, their details instantly appear in the “Registered List” table

~ Fully powered by JavaScript (no page reloads)

✅ Delete Option :

~ Each record has a Delete button

~ First click shows a confirmation alert

~ Second click removes the row permanently

✅ Responsive Design :

~ Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens

~ Styled with a soft purple and teal gradient background and neat form cards

✅ User-Friendly UI :

~ Beautiful box-shadow design

~ Consistent button styling and hover effects

~ Clean typography using Poppins font


🧱 Tech Stack :

~ HTML5 → For structuring the form and table

~ CSS3 → For styling, layout, and responsiveness

~ JavaScript (Vanilla JS) → For adding dynamic interactivity like form handling and deletion


🧠 Learning Highlights :
